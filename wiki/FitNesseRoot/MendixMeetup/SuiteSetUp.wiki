The Suite Setup will run before any suite (or before a test in a suite is executed). If a suite containing multiple tests is run, the SuiteSetUp will only run once.

!*> Fixture imports
!4 This tells Slim which packages contain the test fixtures we'd like to use

|Import                                |
|nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.slim         |
|nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.slim.web     |
|nl.praegus.fitnesse.slim.fixtures.util|

!4 Fixtures defined as a library can be used anywhere in a script- or scenario table, without explicitly instantiating them.
